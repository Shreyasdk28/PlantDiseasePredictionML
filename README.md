# Plant-disease-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting plant diseases based on image data.
this project provides a robust tool for farmers and agricultural experts to identify and manage plant diseases effectively.

## Features
- Disease Detection: Detects plant diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a comprehensive dataset of plant images.
- Image Preprocessing: Includes data augmentation and normalization techniques to improve model accuracy and generalization.
- User Interface: A user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing predictions, built with Streamlit.
- Model Evaluation: Tools for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the models includes a wide range of plant species and associated diseases. Data sources include publicly available datasets from kaggle.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For backend processing and model training.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models.
- OpenCV: For image processing and manipulation.
- Streamlit: For creating the interactive web interface.
